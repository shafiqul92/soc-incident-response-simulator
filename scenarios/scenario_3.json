  "name": "Scenario 3: Mixed Attack Pattern Response",
  "type": "DDoS",
  "description": "Real-world attacks often evolve. In this scenario, you'll face a DDoS attack that starts as a SYN flood but morphs into a mixed SYN/UDP amplification attack. You'll need to adapt your response strategy as the attack pattern changes. This teaches you to monitor attack evolution and coordinate with upstream providers for comprehensive traffic scrubbing when dealing with multi-vector attacks.",
