  "type": "Data Breach",
  "description": "Once attackers gain access, they often attempt to steal sensitive data. This scenario shows active data exfiltration in progress. You'll observe large outbound data transfers, database export commands, and Data Loss Prevention (DLP) alerts detecting sensitive information like Social Security Numbers in the data stream. Time is critical - learn to quickly isolate affected systems to stop the data theft before significant damage occurs.",
