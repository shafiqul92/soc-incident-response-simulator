  "description": "Credential stuffing attacks use automated tools to try thousands of username/password combinations. In this scenario, you'll observe multiple failed login attempts from the same IP address targeting many different accounts. Learn to identify the pattern, recognize when account lockouts are triggered, and implement network-level blocking to stop the attack before credentials are compromised.",
