  "name": "Scenario 1: Initial Traffic Spike Detection",
  "type": "DDoS",
  "description": "In this scenario, you'll observe a sudden and dramatic increase in network traffic to your web server. Watch for indicators like rising connection rates, increasing CPU usage, and degrading server performance. Your goal is to quickly identify this as a potential DDoS attack and take immediate containment actions. You'll practice recognizing early warning signs before the attack fully overwhelms your infrastructure.",
