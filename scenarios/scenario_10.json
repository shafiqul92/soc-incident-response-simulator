  "type": "Ransomware",
  "description": "Containment stops the spread, but eradication removes the threat completely. In this scenario, you'll discover persistence mechanisms (scheduled tasks, registry keys) and command-and-control (C2) infrastructure that the ransomware uses. Learn to identify and remove all persistence mechanisms, block C2 communications, and properly reimage affected systems to ensure a clean recovery without risk of reinfection.",
