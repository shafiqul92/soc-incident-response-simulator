  "name": "Scenario 2: SYN Flood Pattern Recognition",
  "type": "DDoS",
  "description": "This scenario focuses on SYN flood attacks, a common DDoS technique where attackers send many incomplete TCP connection requests. You'll see patterns of incomplete SYN packets, connection pool exhaustion, and increasing timeouts. Learn to distinguish SYN floods from normal traffic and implement appropriate mitigation techniques like SYN cookies or subnet blocking to protect your services.",
