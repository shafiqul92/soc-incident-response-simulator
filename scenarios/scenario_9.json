  "name": "Scenario 9: Ransom Note and Impact Assessment",
  "type": "Ransomware",
  "description": "After ransomware has encrypted files, you'll need to assess the damage and plan recovery. This scenario shows ransom notes being dropped, encryption completion across multiple hosts, and ransom demands. You'll also see that verified backups are available. Learn to make the critical decision: should you pay the ransom or restore from backups? This scenario teaches best practices for ransomware recovery and why paying attackers is generally not recommended.",
