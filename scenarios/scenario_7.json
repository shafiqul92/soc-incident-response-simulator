  "name": "Scenario 7: Initial Ransomware Detection",
  "type": "Ransomware",
  "description": "Ransomware attacks often start with suspicious file activity. In this scenario, you'll see anomalous SMB write operations, unexpected process execution (like encrypt.exe), and files being renamed with suspicious extensions (.locked). You'll also observe shadow copy deletion, which attackers do to prevent recovery. Learn to recognize these early indicators and take immediate containment action before the ransomware spreads across your network.",
