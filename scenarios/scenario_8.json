  "name": "Scenario 8: Lateral Movement Detection",
  "type": "Ransomware",
  "description": "Ransomware doesn't stay on one machine - it spreads. This scenario demonstrates lateral movement via SMB (Server Message Block) protocol. You'll see the ransomware connecting to multiple servers and encrypting files across your network. The attack is spreading rapidly, and you must implement comprehensive containment - isolating affected hosts and blocking SMB network-wide - to prevent further propagation and minimize damage.",
