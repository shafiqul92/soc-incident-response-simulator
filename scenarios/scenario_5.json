  "type": "Data Breach",
  "description": "When an attacker successfully logs in with stolen credentials, they often access from unusual locations. This scenario demonstrates geolocation-based anomaly detection. You'll see a successful login from a country the user has never accessed from before, followed by impossible travel patterns (same user appearing in different countries within minutes). Learn to recognize these red flags and take immediate action to secure the compromised account.",
